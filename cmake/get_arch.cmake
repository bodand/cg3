#   CMake function that takes a rather educated guess at the ISA the current
#   build is for.
#   WARNING: This does not take cross-compilation into account, just probes the
#   current system for this information.
#   On Windows this also requires the winarch util to have been compiled, or
#   at least added as a target.
