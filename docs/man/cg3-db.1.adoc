== SYNOPSIS

*cg3-db* [_OPTIONS_...] <compiler> [_directory_]

== OPTIONS

-?, -h, --help::
    Shows a short help message about available options and parameterization then exits with exit code 1.

-v, --version::
    Shows version information about the currently available cg3-db executable then exits with exit code 0.

-R, --recurse::
    Recurses into the given directory, for up-to four directory layers.
    If not provided cg3-db will only search for sources in the exactly given directory.

-d _<depth_>, --max-depth=_<depth>_::
    Limits recursion to a maximum depth.
    By default recursion is only until 4 directories, but this option can set it to either lower or higher.
    Its value is ignore if *-R* is not specified, and _depth_ 0 is equivalent to not recursing.
